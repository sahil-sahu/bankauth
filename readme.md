# CRUD and Authentication with Graphql

The app is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication system for online transactions. Users can register and log in to the app by taking a selfie and uploading it to the server. The app then uses OpenCV, a library for computer vision, to analyze the facial image and compare it with the stored data in a MySQL database. The app also integrates GraphQL, a query language for APIs, to communicate with the server and the client. The app is built with Node.js and React, two popular frameworks for web development. The app aims to offer a fast, reliable and convenient way to verify users' identities and protect their accounts.
